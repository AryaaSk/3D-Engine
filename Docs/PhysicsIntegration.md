# Physical Integration with CannonJS

## Getting Started
I used CannonJS to integrate phyiscs into my 3D Engine, the basic idea is that there is a physics world, and then you just use aryaa3D to render the objects in that physics world.

### Importing
You will need to import aryaa3D, as well as cannon.js, and the aryaa3D gameHelper.js
```html
<script src="https://aryaask.github.io/3D-Engine/Source/aryaa3D.js"></script>
<script src="https://aryaask.github.io/3D-Engine/GameHelper/PhysicsIntegration/cannon.js"></script>
<script src="https://aryaask.github.io/3D-Engine/GameHelper/gameHelper.js"></script>

<script src="yourownjsfile.js" defer>
```

## Typescript
If you want to use type declarations, then just download the [CannonJS Types]()
